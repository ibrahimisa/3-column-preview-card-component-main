## My process

I started by coding the mobile version first and then added a few lines of media query for the desktop version.

### Built with

- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

- I learned how to add font face from an external file  
  ```css
    @font-face {
      font-family: customName;
      src: url(./location/font.ttf);
  }
  ```
- I also learned sass variables  
  ```scss
  $color: hsl(0, 0%, 95%);
  ```
- And here is some css i am proud of  
  ```css
  display: grid;
  place-items: center;
  ```

### Useful resources

- [CSS units](https://blog.devgenius.io/a-bite-sized-best-practices-guide-for-css-units-em-rem-px-and-more-f621c0d56df4) - This helped me for learning css relative units. Hence i will use it going forward.
